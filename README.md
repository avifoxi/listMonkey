listMonkey
==========

listMonkey is a super simple list making interface, written in complete Vanilla Javascript and CSS. 

No libraries, no frameworks, just you, a list, and a monkey. 
Purely a Front End MVC excersize, borrowing heavily from [this article](http://alexatnet.com/articles/model-view-controller-mvc-javascript). 

Commune with your list making monkey [here](http://avifoxi.github.io/listMonkey/).
